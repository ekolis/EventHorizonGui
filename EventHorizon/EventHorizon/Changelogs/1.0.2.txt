Version 1.0.2
February 19, 2010

New Features:
- A savegame can be loaded by passing it in as a command line argument (e.g. EventHorizon.exe savegames\EDSJ_30_Nick.gam)
- Application now has an icon.
- Battle replay delay rate now depends in part on the number of rounds of combat, such that long battles will be more time-compressed than shorter battles.
	A battle with 9 salvos will proceed at the same rate as in the old system, while longer battles will be time-compressed and shorter battles will be time-dilated.
	Battles are time-compressed proportional to the square root of the number of salvos, so a battle with 4x as many salvos as another battle will play out in 2x the time, not 4x the time.
	The slider still controls the base delay factor.

Bug Fixes:
- Shipsets were being loaded from a path relative to the savegame. Now they are loaded relative to the executable, as intended.
- Crashes (such as would occur when loading an invalid savegame file) are now handled more gracefully.
- Battle replays now start immediately when the play button is clicked, instead of waiting for the first timer tick.

Misc. Changes
- Ship death explosions are no longer scaled to the ship; they are always displayed full size. This should make distinguishing between damage and death of small ships easier.
