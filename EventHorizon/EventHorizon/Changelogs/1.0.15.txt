Version 1.0.15
April 27, 2010

Bug Fixes:
- Wraparound on the X-axis is fixed. Ship arrows should no longer appear in the wrong place, or crash the game when they arrive on the other side.

Misc. Changes:
- Ship images are no longer preloaded when the game is loaded.
	While this will create a slight pause when clicking any sector or ship for the first time, it greatly reduces the initial loading time, which was getting excessive in the later stages of the game!
- Each ship no longer has its own image created for it; instead, images are looked up based on the ship's size and status.
	This should reduce the negative impact of no longer preloading images, as well as save memory.
