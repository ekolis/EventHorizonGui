Version 1.0.8
March 16, 2010

New Features:
- Battle replays now show "CRITICAL HIT!" and "TARGET DESTROYED!" text in the appropriate circumstances.

Bug Fixes:
- Right-click movement wasn't working when it was off the edge of the map to a wraparound sector.
- Size of beams in battle replays was dependent on damage inflicted. Now it's dependent on number of shots fired in the salvo, as intended.

Misc. Changes:
- Replaced dull checkboxes for ship armed/mobile/mothership status with icons.
