Version 1.0.18
June 9, 2010

New Features:
- "Nostic" shipset, a silly set with a nasal theme!
- The ship list can now be toggled between local (the standard view) and global (all ships in the game, regardless of location) mode.

Bug Fixes:
- Customized sector names now appear in the battle replay window title bar.

Misc. Changes:
- You can now issue move commands even when some enemy ships are selected in addition to your own ships. The enemy ships will of course ignore your orders!
