Version 1.0.12
March 22, 2010

Bug Fixes:
- Players that you lose contact with are no longer forgotten in the empires list.
	Note: you'll have to regain contact with any empires you lost contact with in a prior version in order to see them listed again.
- Enemy shipsets are no longer reset to default every turn.
	Note: this change will reset your own shipset, but once set after upgrading, it should remain set!
